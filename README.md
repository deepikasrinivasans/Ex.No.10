## Aim:
To develop and implement prompt-based generation of business reports and case studies using Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating how structured prompts and refinement techniques improve clarity, consistency, and factual accuracy in professional documentation.

---
## AI Tools Required

ChatGPT or any other Large Language Model (LLM) such as Google Gemini or Microsoft Copilot.

## Algorithm

1. Start by identifying business communication patterns (report, case study, proposal, or strategy brief).
2. Study prompt patterns such as query decomposition, decision making, semantic filtering, answer engineering, and tail generation.
3. Choose a business topic or scenario (e.g., marketing growth, AI in customer analytics).
4. Create basic prompts to generate initial drafts.
5. Refine the prompt by applying advanced techniques to control tone, structure, and data consistency.
6. Compare results between simple and refined prompts.
7. Evaluate and finalize the business document for accuracy and presentation quality.

## Procedure:

1. **Understanding Prompt Patterns**
   - Query Decomposition: Break down business topics into measurable parts.
   - Decision Making: Guide AI to select between strategies or directions.
   - Answer Engineering: Specify structure, e.g., executive summary, strategy, results.
   - Semantic Filter: Maintain business tone and professionalism.
   - Tail Generation: Extend the report with recommendations.
   - Fact-Check List: Verify accuracy and numerical details.
